FSP is a web application, built with React, that has three distinct users.

1. Researchers: these people are not affiliated with the company, but they contribute their educational research to the company for implementation in classrooms.
2. Editors: learning specialists hired by the company to curate the articles submitted by researchers into lesson plans.
3. Educators: anyone looking for content to enhance their lesson plans for using in their classrooms.

See "Usage" for more details.

## Usage

The three user types interact differently with PFS. Each user has directions on the screen.

1.  Reseachers firsts submit the name of their article, their own name & an abstract of their research.

Once the article information is submitted, the "Article Information" box is replaced with a file upload box. The researcher then submits their article as a PDF (other file types are also accepted) using our drag-and-drop file uploader, or by clicking if they prefer to select their file from a file tree.

2. Editors can search for submitted articles by grade level and then download the corresponding file. The Editor will curate a lesson plan
   and submit it through the portal inserting required fields and uploading a document using the drag & drop function.

3. Educators can search for lesson plans by grade number. Lesson plan previews are available by clicking on "view details" which will also allow the user to download the corresponding file. Educators can also leave a review of the lesson plan in a comments section so that other users may benefit from their feedback.

## Future Development

- Improve lesson plan searchability for educators, allowing them to search for specific subjects, keywords, etc.

## License

No license: When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.
